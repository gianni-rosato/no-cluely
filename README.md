Cluely is an ~~undetectable~~ AI that sees your screen, hears your calls, and feeds you answers ‚Äî in real time

## Detectable by Design

## What goes on under the hood
- **üö´ Screen Capture Evasion**: Windows configured with `sharing_state = 0` to avoid screen recording
- **üîº Elevated Layer Positioning**: Windows using elevated display layers (e.g., `layer = 3`) to stay above screen capture

A CS:GO cheater would have had an easier time making a VAC bypass than this. Having your active process named "cluely" is like shouting out you're cheating.

## The detection

Available here [/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/terminalsin/no-cluely/blob/master/src/lib.rs)
```rust
let window_id = get_dict_int(window_dict, WINDOW_NUMBER);
let sharing_state = get_dict_int(window_dict, WINDOW_SHARING_STATE);
let layer = get_dict_int(window_dict, WINDOW_LAYER);

let window_info = WindowInfo {
    owner,
    window_id,
    sharing_state,
    layer,
};

result.is_detected = true;
result.window_count += 1;

// Check for specific evasion techniques
if sharing_state == 0 {
    result.screen_capture_evasion_count += 1;
}
```

# SDKs (Integrate detection in your app!)

This library provides SDKs for:
- [x] Python
- [ ] Java
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Swift

## üêç  Python
```bash
pip install no-cluely
```

### Simple Detection
```python
from no_cluely import NoCluely

# Quick check
if NoCluely.is_cluely_running():
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Employee monitoring detected!")
else:
    print("‚úÖ No monitoring software found")
```

### Detailed Analysis
```python
from no_cluely import NoCluely

detection = NoCluely.detect_cluely_detailed()

if detection.is_detected:
    print(f"üö® Cluely Detected!")
    print(f"   Severity: {detection.severity_level}")
    print(f"   Windows: {detection.window_count}")
    print(f"   Techniques: {', '.join(detection.evasion_techniques)}")
else:
    print("‚úÖ System clean")
```
